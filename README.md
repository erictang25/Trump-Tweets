# Trump-Tweets

The goal is to classify the device that Trump used to write each tweet with. It's been hypothesized that President Trump tweets only from his android phone and that someone else tweets from his account using an iphone. Analyze the text of the tweet as well as other contextual information to predict where each tweet came from.
